      <h1>CS 685 &mdash; Assignment 5. Paul McKerley</h1>
      <p>I first wanted to caveat this by saying I looked at many OpenCV tutorial pages for example of how to do things. 
      <ol>

		<p>The two images below show the Harris corners on the original picture
	    and the rotated one. It appears that the corners are
	    rotated with the image. This is especially apparent in the
	    windows, along the roofline, on the roof itself, and in
	    the two roughly parallel lines of corner on the left hand
	    side of the first image. However, the correspondance is
	    not perfect. If one looks carefully at the windows one can
	    see that there are discprepancies in the number of red
	    dots on each window.</p>

	    </li>
	    <p><a href="harris.py">Here is the code I used</a> to
	    create these images. Note that I used a threshold of 0.2
	    for which corners to keep, to cut down on the visual noise
	    in the images. This may account somewhat for the small
	    discrpancies noted in the previous two images.
	    <li>
	      <p>I didn't find the image house1-4down.jpg in the code
	      directory, so I created one using the ImageMagick
	      command: <pre>"convert -scale 320x240 house1.jpg house1-4down.jpg"</pre>
	      </p>
	      <p>Here are comparisons between the scaled versions of
	      house1.jpg. The same corners are represented in each
	      pair of images. Again, there are small discrepancies,
		which might be related to the use of a the threshold.
	      </p>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    I used <a href="ssd_harris.py">this Python program</a> to
	    use SSD to match the corner features in house1.jpg and
	    house2.jpg. It basically finds all the corners in each
	    image and does a brute force full comparison of SSD
	    patches around all the corners in the first image with
	    those in the second. I again used a threshold for setting
	    a maximum SSD value I would accept for a match. This
	    varied on the size of the SSD patch I used. In this case,
	    I used a patch-size of 31. The first image is with a
	    higher threshold, and lots of spurious match. The second
	    image has a tighter threshold, and gets rid of a lot of
	    the bad matches.

	<li>
	  <p> I used <a href="sift_matching.py">this code</a> to
	    make SIFT comparisons between the pairs of images. I also
	    used a threshold to filter on the match distance.
